# Assessing Range Shifts of Coastal Species to Inform Conservation in California’s Biogeographic Transition Zones

## Overview
This project will inform a strategic conservation plan for monitoring and preserving biodiversity under climate change within the Dangermond Preserve. 
In collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, we will utilize statistical analysis to model current species distribution ranges and predict potential 
futures to be compiled in a public-facing web dashboard.

## Project Deliverables

We envision the below deliverables to be compiled into a web-based interactive map where users can explore the species distribution models,
with possible side-panels showing changes in abundance over time, and the report card value per species.

### Objective 1: 
#### Identify and map rocky shore species range edges along California’s coast.

A map portraying the California coastline broken into equal-size sections (i.e. 0.5-degree latitude or
100 km chunks), indicating the number of rocky intertidal species with northern/southern range
edges in each section of the coastline. A list of species which have range edges within the coastal
section encompassing Point Conception. These products are intended for conservation, grant
proposals/donors, and as an educational resource.

### Objective 2: 
#### Characterize potential species range shifts occurring within the Point Conception region.

A summary table for each species with range edges near Point Conception from Objective 1 listing
any significant changes in abundance over time within the Point Conception region. For those species
experiencing a range expansion near Point Conception, an indication of whether the shift is in the
arrival, increase, or persistence stage. This will be used by TNC to develop a coastal monitoring plan
and a preserve management access plan for the public.

### Objective 3: 
#### Predict species range shifts into the future.

Habitat suitability maps from species distribution models of each species with range edges near
Point Conception (from Objective 1), projected under future climate scenarios. This product is
intended to be used as an interactive tool and contribute to the future of the coastal monitoring plan.

### Objective 4: 
#### Create a range shift species list and a ranking system to prioritize monitoring for coastal range extensions/retractions within the Preserve.

A ‘report card’ for each of the species with range edges near Point Conception, representing the
degree of change compared to changes in abundance over time for the other sections of the coastline,
as well as the likelihood that they will shift past this transition zone from the species distribution
models. This product is also intended to be seen in conjunction with the interactive map to explore
potential species range extensions/contractions.

## Data Description

### Data files (acquired from data request from MARINe, early 2024):
- MARINe_longterm_data -> yearly photoplot data of targeted species assemblages
  - Phototranssummarysd_download.csv = summarized photo transect data, averaged across plots
  - Phototranraw_download.csv = raw photo transect data, percent cover per plot
- MARINe_biodiversity_data -> community-wide biodiversity data
  - cbs_data_CA_2023.xlsx = raw biodiversity data, includes its own metadata tab, point contact data for transects, quadrats and swaths
  - marine_species_taxonomy.csv = metadata on species taxonomy
